## Craig and mitch

### 1 slide explaining a question you hoped your exploratory analysis would answer

- Yes -- their question is: what is the largest donation, who is it for, and who did it go to?
- They then did a z-score of the donations and looked @ how average polling related to donations



### 1 slide describing the code and methods you used to perform your analysis

- Yup - but the slide is hard to read
- Didn't use R code to pull the data, but talked us through how to do it
- Computed the mean of the contributions without removing the mean
- multiple slides for this

### 1 slide (with a graph!) describing the result

- that is a big z-score :)
- but where is your graph??
- got a graph in for the second part


### 1 slide that lists what you’ve liked about the class thus far

- yes

### 1 slide that lists things you would change about the class for the second half of the semester

- less time on the homework -- sorry :)
- 

### general comments

- they clearly both did 1/2 and combined, which is good
- did a good job answering how they could have excluded the negative donations even though they got it wrong
- nice job presenting and nice slides

- great job workign out what the default of stat='identity' was and how to solve it
- great work with the ggplot to investigate the correlation between polling % and total gifts
    - and a great interpretation of the correlation between gifts and polling pct
- olivia gave separate presentation basically
    - all second half of slide deck was her
    - but she hit all of the things she needed to do
